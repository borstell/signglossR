Description: This package is intended to facilitate a visual representation of 
    sign language data by incorporating videos and images alongside written glosses 
    and translations. This includes quick and easy downloads of videos/images from 
    various online sign language resources, but also information about glosses, 
    entries, and identifiers used in these resources.
